<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Akinmoladun Blessing Oladimeji,
  <br>I'm a student of Olusegun Agagu University of Science and Technology. I'm also an Industrial Chemistry Student.
  <br>I am learning Web Development Course frome Udemy.  hope to be a perfect Web developer in the closest future.
</p>

<p>I should have learnt all of these since ooo, i think since like 2022, but i was so lazy and there was no money for subscription too.
  <br> Plus, there was no network at my place... hummmm until i heard about the people that went for Uncle Tony's wedding and how much they spent... trust me, i was moved ooo.
  <br> So, i spoke to Uncle Juwon and he added me to the Inventor's group but as God will have it, it was towrads the end of 400level 1st semester and i had to do exam and leave for siwes 2nd semester... hummmm
</p>

<p>
  I went for siwes at Transcorp in Abuja and they used me with no money and the little time i had, i rest plus where i was staying was not conducive, bed bugs everywhere, i could not sit or stand without getting bit by bedbug
  <br> I fell sick almost everyweek, the enivironment was dirty, see i have story to tell...
  <br>i just hope and pray that God will help me and i'll learn, understand and contine coding and i'll be getting money from it too.
<br>That's just a little about my journey, i know i still have a whole lot to say though, but Thank God for how fa he has brought me.
